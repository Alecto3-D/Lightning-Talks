# Lightning-Talks
Guideline for the community Lightning Talks on Surrey CodeCamp

Every Lightning talk that we do, is located on the prefered format inside the Lightning talks folder, please feel free to check if your talk was not done before. Of course this does not mean that you can't do it, but you can add aditional content and context.
